Welcome to **M**ulti-**M**odal **S**ign Language **T**ranslator!

You can run front-end after having installed all the backend's requirements.
If you have all the requirements open a terminal in backend's folder and type: fastapi dev main.py
You also need nodeJS to run the npm command, you can download it from: https://nodejs.org/

the following npm install instruction can be skipped after the first launch.

Then on another terminal open in the main folder, if you want to run the frontend run:
cd frontend
npm install package.json
npm install wavesurfer.js
npm start

and go to your browser

If an error is return on FFmpeg, then on the temrinal type: pip install FFmpeg
